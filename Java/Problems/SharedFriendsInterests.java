/**
 * There are friends_nodes friends numbered from 1 to friends_nodes.
 * There are friends_edges pairs of friends, where each (xi, yi) pair of friends
 * is connected by a shared integer Interest described by friends_weighti.
 * Any two friends, xi and yi, can be connected by zero or more Interest because
 * if friends xi and yi share Interest ti and friends yi and zi also share
 * Interest ti, then xi and zi are also said to share Interest ti.
 * 
 * Find the maximal product of xi and yi for any directly or indirectly
 * connected (xi, yi) pair of friends such that xi and yi share the maximal
 * number of Interest with each other.
 * 
 * Name Type Description
 * friends_nodes integer The number of friends.
 * friends_from integer array Each friends_from[i] (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges)
 * denotes the first friend in pair (friends_from[i], friends_to[i]).
 * friends_to integer array Each friends_to[i] (where 0 ≤ i < friends_edges)
 * denotes the second friend in pair (friends_from[i], friends_to[i]).
 * friends_weight integer array Each friends_weight[i] (where 0 ≤ i <
 * friends_edges) denotes the ID number of a Interest shared by both
 * friends_from[i] and friends_to[i].
 * Note: friends_edges is the number of pairs of friends that directly share a
 * Interest.
 * 
 * The function must return an integer denoting the maximal product of xi and yi
 * such that xi and yi are a pair of friends that share the maximal number of
 * Interest with each other.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the
 * respective values of friends_nodes and friends_edges.
 * Each line i of the friends_edges subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i <
 * friends_edges) contains three space-separated integers describing the
 * respective values of friends_fromi, friends_toi, and friends_weighti.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 2 ≤ friends_nodes ≤ 100
 * 1 ≤ friends_edges ≤ min(200, (friends_nodes × (friends_nodes − 1)) / 2)
 * 1 ≤ friends_weighti ≤ 100
 * 1 ≤ friends_fromi, friends_toi ≤ friends_nodes
 * 1≤ friends_weighti ≤ friends_edges
 * friends_fromi ≠ friends_toi
 * Each pair of friends can be connected by zero or more types of Interest.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * Return an integer denoting the maximal product of xi and yi such that xi and
 * yi are a pair of friends that share the maximal number of Interest with each
 * other.
 * 
 * Sample Input 0
 * 4 5
 * 1 2 1
 * 1 2 2
 * 2 3 1
 * 2 3 3
 * 2 4 3
 * 
 * Sample Output 0
 * 6
 * 
 * Explanation 0
 * Each pair of n = 4 friends is connected by the following Interest:
 * 
 * Pair (1, 2) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 2)
 * Pair (1, 3) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 1)
 * Pair (1, 4) shares 0 Interest
 * Pair (2, 3) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 3)
 * Pair (2, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)
 * Pair (3, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)
 * 
 * The pairs connected by the maximal number of Interest are (1, 2) and (2, 3).
 * Their respective products are 1 × 2 = 2 and 2 × 3 = 6. We then return the
 * largest of these values as our answer, which is 6.
